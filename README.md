# ReachDigital Magento 2 Performance tuned integration tests

- Boots up the integration test framework in less than 300ms when caches are
  primed.
- Adds the ability to automatically install TestModules.

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev reach-digital/magento2-test-framework
```

## Usage

After the installation of the package there will be a folder
`dev/tests/quick-integration` with the new integration test framework. Copy
`phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml` and make your changes to include your own
namespaces.

## Test Execution

To get the fastest result, execute the quick integration with plain `phpunit`
like so:

```bash
# Running Quick integration tests via phpunit
cd dev/tests/integration
php ../../../vendor/bin/phpunit -c ../quick-integration/phpunit.xml
```

A more convenient, but slower execution can be done via `bin/magento` itself.
Make sure, you add the `-c` option to in order to apply to correct
configuration.

```bash
# Running Quick integration tests via bin/magento
php bin/magento dev:tests:run integration -c $(pwd)/dev/tests/quick-integration/phpunit.xml
```

### TestModule

Automatically installs test modules that are available in the following path:
`vendor/*/*/TestModule/*/*` so for example
`vendor/reach-digital/magento2-order-source-reservations/TestModule/Magento/TestModuleInventoryStateCache`.

## Goals

- Have the startup time of the integration test framework below 300ms.
- Have no feature regressions for small batches of test.
- Show helpful messages to speed up your tests

## Non-Goals

- Be a complete replacement for the complete integration test suite, only
  support the small suite that you test locally will be fine.

## Motivation

Magento 2's integration tests are notoriously slow in booting up, which makes
practicing TDD a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to wait more than 10 seconds for
tests to start..

Speed matters, but Magento developer have grown accustomed that things are just
slow.

> - 0 to 100ms: Respond to user actions within this time window and users feel
>   like the result is immediate. Any longer, and the connection between action
>   and reaction is broken.
> - 100 to 300ms: Users experience a slight perceptible delay.
> - 300 to 1000ms: Within this window, things feel part of a natural and
>   continuous progression of tasks. For most users on the web, loading pages or
>   changing views represents a task.
> - 1000ms or more: Beyond 1000 milliseconds (1 second), users lose focus on the
>   task they are performing.
> - 10000ms or more: Beyond 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds), users are
>   frustrated and are likely to abandon tasks. They may or may not come back

Currently it is no exception for the integration tests to run more than 10000ms:
"Developers get frustrated, are likely to abandon the test. They may or may not
try TDD again later."

To put it in perspective: It is faster to load an Admin Page, click a button
there than it is to click Play on a test.. it should not be this way.

Because: **If Magento is able to render a complete html-page under 200ms,
shouldn't a test be able to start at least as quickly as well?**

## Performance improvements

So the idea is that Magento is probably cleaning a lof of cache while booting
up, running additional tests, etc. If we can prevent the cleaning of cache,
state, etc. we can achieve much higher performance and maybe even surpass the
frontend.

_Although this is probably a good idea to have 'clean slate', it isn't even a
great idea per s√©. Code should be resiliant and should be able to run with
warmed cache and cold cache.._

### 1. Disable memory cleanup scripts

Speed improvement; ~10-20s

By disabling the following classes we get the biggest speed improvement.

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);
\Magento\TestFramework\Workaround\Cleanup\TestCaseProperties::class;
\Magento\TestFramework\Workaround\Cleanup\StaticProperties::class;
```

### 2. Fix overzealous app reinitialisation

Speed improvement; ~50ms

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);
//Rewrites Magento's AppIsolation class
\ReachDigital\TestFramework\Annotation\AppIsolation::class;
```

### 3. Disable config-global.php by default

Speed improvement; ~280ms

The config-global.php.dist will always set some config values, but this requires
reinitialisation of the config. By not using this functionality we shave another
300ms off the request.

### 4. Disabled sequence table generation

Speed improvement; ~400ms

By default Magento creates all sequence tables

## Quality of life improvements

### 1. Moved the generation folder back to the root

Usually an IDE doesn't like it when duplicate classes exist, because of this
reason the `dev/test/integration/tmp/sandbox-*` directory should be ignored. By
moving the generated folder to the root of the project we get the benefit that
the IDE can inspect those classes.

### 2. Disable modules while running tests, copies `app/etc/config.php`
